<div id="center"><h1>~ Whole Food Nutrition ~</h1>
by Paul Williams, MD
<br><br>
It is now abundantly clear that the basic nutrition needed by the human body is found only in whole foods, especially the plant kingdom: fruits, vegetables, and grains.
<br><br>
Even though you will read about the newly-discovered role of one certain nutrient or another, as it relates to healing and prevention, you also will read that the experts say you should get your nutrition from fruits and vegetables, not from pills of individual, isolated nutrients. This is because the whole foods contain thousands of nutrients, most of which have not yet been studied enough for us to know their role in human physiology. We do know, however, that many of these nutrients are interdependent, i.e., they cannot function fully without many other nutrients being present at the same time. As the benefits of more and more of these thousands of nutrients are discovered, will you add more and more pills to your daily regimen of supplements, all in an effort to be sure you are getting all the nutrients you need?
<br><br>
It makes much more sense to me to take in all of these nutrients on a daily basis, thus being sure your body has everything it knows how to use to stay as healthy as possible. So you will now start eating multiple servings a day of fresh, raw fruits and vegetables, right? Please make the effort to eat more fruits and vegetables every day, and teach your children to do the same.
<br><br>
If you know you can't or won't do this, I recommend the whole-food based supplement Juice Plus+®. Juice Plus+® provides added nutrition from 17 different fruits, vegetables and grains, ripened on the plant, and reduced to capsule and chewable forms through a juicing and drying process. The independent medical studies completed on Juice Plus+® clearly show that the nutrition from the foods is present and is easily absorbed into the body. These studies also show that there is significant improvement in anti-oxidant nutrition and in immune system function.
<br><br>
Your body has a tremendous capacity to heal problems and prevent disease -- but it can't do it without all the nutrients that take part in those processes. Juice Plus+® will help supply that whole-food based nutrition your body needs.
