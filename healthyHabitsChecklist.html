<br>1. Stress Relief: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Physical, mental, emotional stress needs to be Biblically dealt with; A personal relationship with God through His Son, Yeshua (Jesus) our Messiah, and daily Bible study and prayer time is the BEST stress relief available. "Cast all your cares on Him,"( Psalm 55:22) and give Him your life and ask Him to show you your specific life purpose. Know that your life is worth living; the Creator of the entire universe made you, loves you, sent Yeshua to die for you to save you from your sin and from eternal damnation if you'll repent of your sin, and He has a specific purpose for your life in His service. 
<br><br>
2. Good Nutrition:
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Fresh, raw fruits and veggies, and freshly made juices, preferably organic; whole grains, nuts and seeds; 85% raw, 15% cooked is recommended by many natural health doctors because of the desperate need the body has for an alkaline pH level and also for enzymes, the workers and catalysts in the body. Enzymes die when heated above 106 degrees. 
<br><br>
3. Fresh Air: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>94% of your body's nutritional need is oxygen!!!! Deep breathe and exercise outside in the fresh air and sunshine every day. Sleep with your window open; (inside air increases tumor growth.) 
<br><br>
4. Exercise daily:
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Start slowly and exercise in the fresh air and sunshine whenever possible to maximize benefits.. 
<br><br>
5. Sunlight:
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Don't overdose;; get early morning or late afternoon sun, rather than midday sun. Study the benefits of sunshine! 
<br><br>
6. Rest: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>The hours from 10:00 til 2:00 are the best"healing hormone" producing time IF WE ARE ALSEEP so be asleep by 10. Adjust your lifestyle so that you get 8 hours of sleep nightly. Go to bed by 9:00 if you have a health problem. 
<br><br>
7. Water:
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Drink several glasses of pure water daily, in addition to the fresh fruit and veggie juices you are consuming daily. You lose 10 glasses of water a day just in daily metabolism function. Dehydration is a VERY serious health problem. 
<br><br>
8. Eliminate toxins: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Eliminate chemicals, drugs, preservatives, additives, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. from your life and body. (Weaning from drugs must be done gradually and under a health care professional's direction.) Also, do a good colon cleanse regularly to stop autointoxication from bowel. (Eliminate toxic attitudes also; :) :) Forgive offenders daily. Matthew 6:14,15.) 
<br><br>
9. Have a constant attitude of gratitude: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Thank people sincerely and often. 
<br>Send gratitude notes regularly; Praise God constantly;
<br>"In everything, give thanks." ( I Thessalonians 5:17) 
<br><br>
Choose "life" in attitudes as well as foods. 
<br>Be joyful and positive. (James 1:2.) 
<br><br>
10. Have a benevolent spirit: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
<br>Give of yourself to others daily; pray for others daily 
<br>and bless someone in some way daily. 
<br><br>
11. Bankruptcy repayment: 
<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 
<br>Include extra nutrients in your daily diet to help catch up for the many years of the "bankrupt" nutritional state of your body: ”Juice Plus”, live whole food powders in a capsule or chewable gummy; (Juice Plus foods are dehydrated at low temperatures so that they are still “living” foods that have living enzymes), Young Living therapeutic food grade essential oils from plants boost the immune system, reverse DNA damage, etc., just like fresh raw fruits and veggies do: Green drinks, (see section on recipes), Essential Fatty Acids like flax seed oil, walnut oil, avocados and other omega 3 oils, prebiotics and probiotics (see information on Prescript-Assist), extra live whole food enzymes to start to make up for the disastrous deficit in the body from so many years of cooked food that had no enzymes, an all natural progesterone cream to balance the estrogen dominance caused by plastics, detergents, pesticides, herbicides, meats and poultry. Colon cleansers are needed to make sure you have an effective bowel movement after each meal. Many health clinics recommend enemas to assist in cleansing the colon.
