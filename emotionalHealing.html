<h1>~ Emotional Healing ~</h1>
by Dr. Kent Bartell
<br><br>
God gave each of us a body, mind, and spirit. When the mind or spirit are not healthy the body can not be healthy. Most physical problems begin as emotional hurts or blockages of the heart years prior to the physical symptom ever being noticed. Working with the physical body to balance the tissues, chemistry, & the nervous system will allow a platform of stability for deeper emotional issues of the heart to be addressed. True and lasting healing can only come once all areas of your life are in the process of being made whole. Only when emotional issues are addressed through the truth and grace of God’s light, can health and fulfillment of purpose be realized. Words of truth that speak to the heart are different than words that speak to the mind. Speaking truth to the heart encourages the heart to be open so that the expression of God's love can be experienced. Once this begins, healing, clarity, freedom from depression, and peace are the ultimate result. 
<br><br>
<strong>Emotional-Spiritual Health & Physical Health </strong>
<br>
Are you aware that there is a link between your emotional health and your physical health? Many times when you are physically sick, you may not attribute it to how you are doing emotionally. Many people are not truly in touch with their emotions. (Consequently, you may be unable to identify with if you are feeling depression, anxious, angry, afraid or resentful.) When you have a headache, you may take a pain reliever and go about your day, not acknowledging your emotions and what you are feeling. It has been found that certain emotions are associated with certain physical organs in the body. 
<br><br>
For example, anger is associated with the liver, resentment is associated with the gallbladder, grief is associated with the lungs, fear is associated with the kidneys. When a patient comes in with liver problems, they often have a pattern and history of anger in their lives. The anger has been suppressed and they are not yet consciously aware of it. A patient may come in with lower back pain, and we have commonly been aware of money problems or financial concerns. A patient with TMJ (temperomandibular joint) or with gallbladder problems will commonly have a desire for revenge. The associations between the physical body and emotions are endless. 
<br><br>
Deeply rooted emotions that are not dealt with will eventually manifest into chronic problems affecting the associated organs. Generational or genetic weaknesses also contribute to illness, but the emotional issues that are layered on top of that is what usually causes the 'cup to overflow'. Many people are aware that it is not possible to separate the relationship between the body, mind, and spirit, as they are all interconnected. The traditional medical community is increasingly acknowledging this connection. The body, mind and spirit are interconnected and influence each other, creating the need to address all three aspects in order to achieve wholeness. Health and wholeness can only be attained through balance. God made you with a body, mind and spirit because you are to use all three of them. If you do this in a balanced way, you will be operating at an optimum level with more effectiveness and efficiency. This may help you gain freedom from depression enabling you to accomplish what God has called you to do and to do it with excellence. 
<br><br>
Many individuals appear spiritually sound and yet are overweight and unhealthy (demonstrating imbalance). How long will they be able to continue to be effective without the health of their body? Obesity may not be a concern for some, but they may be so busy taking care of their health that they haven't left time to meet their spiritual or emotional needs (imbalance). There is also the person who spends all their time and energy feeding their minds with information and they neglect their health and do not feed their spirit (imbalance). This lack of balance is not wholeness and is not efficient. You need to be operating at the level God designed you to. To be fulfilled, free of depression, content, and have peace, you must strive for wholeness, which means addressing your body, mind, and spirit. 
<br><br>
<strong>The Journey Toward Wholeness</strong> 
<br>
It is human nature when you're sick to find out what is physically wrong. You may spend years addressing your physical health, yet still remain sick. After exhausting most health care options, from traditional medicine to alternative, you may begin to question whether you're sick emotionally or spiritually. For example, a traumatic childhood memory may never have been addressed in your life. It is common to have memories that are affecting us today that we have completely suppressed. As God begins to bring remembrance of these memories, He does so for the purpose of healing. This breakthrough can often assist in healing chronic health problems. Deep emotional blockages can prevent healing. Emotional blockages are commonly from suppressed traumatic memories, unforgiveness, judgments, vows, and lies we've believed. Getting to the emotional roots with the 'light of truth' illuminating the past, plays an integral part in setting someone free. God has a purpose for each of our lives. If we are crippled physically, emotionally, and spiritually , we lack the the freedom to function well. With freedom, health, and wholeness, we can begin to actualize God's purpose in our lives, and help bring freedom to others.

<strong>Tools for Inner Healing</strong> 
<br><br>
<strong>The Heart</strong> 
<br>
Psalms 7:9 says O righteous God, who searches our minds and hearts. Mark 7: 6 says, Jesus replied, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written. "These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me." 1 Thess 2:4, We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts. Luke 16:15 says, "you are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. God is very concerned about the condition of our hearts. But what exactly is meant by the heart? The Greek word for the heart is Kardia which means 'thoughts or feelings'. The King James study bible says the heart refers to the reasoning, understanding, will, judgment, designs, affections, love, hatred, fear, joy, sorrow, and anger. When we deal with emotions, we need to look at the issues of the heart. Mat 15:18-19 says, "But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man unclean." For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony (lies), slander (gossip). 'For out of the heart come evil thoughts' would suggest that those issues were already in the heart. Issues of unforgiveness, judgments, vows and believed lies effect a person's emotional and spiritual health. Another issue of the heart is suppressed memories, which we will discuss later. 
<br><br>
<strong>Unforgiveness</strong>
<br>
Mat 6:14 says, "For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive you sins." This is a well-known verse, but do we really apply this to our daily lives? How do we really forgive? There is confusion amongst many Christians whether they have really forgiven the person who has hurt them. Here are some tools that can be helpful. The first tool is to simply make a clear-cut choice to forgive the person that has hurt you. To forgive even if you don't feel like it is what God tells us to do. The Bible tells us that if we do not forgive, we will not be forgiven of our own offenses. Once you choose to forgive by an act of your will, God will then give you the Grace to let go of the offense. Forgiveness is something that we need to do on a daily basis. Each time you choose to forgive, you allow God to change your heart. 
<br><br>
Everyday there are opportunities to choose to forgive, even the 'little things'. We need to forgive even for the smallest of offenses we may experience each day. Remember that unforgiveness begins to add up and will start to harden the heart. Eph 4:18, "they are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts." Daily with every offensive situation you face, choose to forgive. Duet 30:19, "that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord you God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to Him." The ultimate goal is to remain in an atmosphere of forgiveness, focused on God through humility so that you never even take offence when someone wrongs you.
<br><br>
<strong>Judgments</strong>
<br>
Judgments, vows, and unforgiveness often go hand in hand. What exactly is a judgment? Webster's dictionary defines it is an opinion or criticism. Most of us are more critical than we realize. Even though we don't always hear someone's critical thoughts, we can often feel or sense them. For instance, have you ever been talking to someone, and you suddenly had a self-conscious feeling? You may be sensing a judgment from that person. Sometimes we may think that as long as we don't verbally voice the criticism that it is not felt or "sent out". The other person may sense your judgment by the energy your putting out. The tone of your voice, or a look in conversation can often communicate more non-verbally than words that are actually spoken. 
<br><br>
Judgments can also be when we form opinions about people that we don't like. Mat 7:1 says, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." Do you judge? What exactly does judging sound like? Mat 7:5, "You hypocrite, first take the plank out of you own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye." The criticism or judgment you have toward someone may be true, yet still a judgment. Judgment is for the Lord. 1Corinthians 4:4 says, "It is the Lord who judges." Psalm 75:7 says, "But it is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another." What we believe God would judge and what He judges may be two different things. Romans 14:3 says, "The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him." 
<br><br>
<strong>Vows</strong>
<br>
Webster's dictionary defines a vow as a solemn promise or pledge, especially one made to God. A vow often comes after a judgment. If there is a 'never' or 'always' in your statement to yourself along with a charged emotion, it is a vow. Here are some examples of common vows - "I will never be like my mother or father!" "I will always be alone!" "I will never be hurt like that again!"
<br><br>
Vows are often made so quickly that we aren't always aware we made them. So how do you know then if you have made a vow? We may need to recall an incident or event that has been painful. Many times when you discuss your feelings about a situation, you will say "I never", or "I always". This is one way of finding the vow that you have made. You can also look at what is currently going on in your life. Is there a judgment about someone in your past that you may have thought "I will never be like them". Or, have you become an adult and then noticed doing the very same things that you despised in your parents when you were a child? The very thing you vowed not to do, is the very thing you ended up doing. Sometimes it is 'camouflaged' and has manifested itself in another form. With a little searching, you can get to the root or vow. Vows of your heart are like roots of a tree feeding imbalanced perceptions of bondage into your life. Removing these roots is a key part of becoming free. Once you are aware of what vows are, the Holy Spirit will usually begin to reveal to you a vow that you have made. When that happens, right then and there ask the Lord to forgive you for making the judgment and vow, then choose to forgive what ever needs to be forgiven concerning the situation. Next, ask God to forgive you for taking control of that part of your life. Then pray out loud, "I renounce the vow that I will never"... and finish the statement. This is an on going process which is part of allowing God to heal your past and give Him control of your life in these areas. It is necessary that you release your "will" in the areas you have made vows. God has promised He will not override your "will" so you must release it to Him by choice. Once you seriously begin to apply these laws set up by God, it can become an exciting adventure to experience higher and higher levels of freedom and peace everyday. 
<br><br>
<strong>Taking Responsibility</strong>
<br>
You must begin to take responsibility for the "bad fruit" in your life. You need to 'own' the fact that you have created the bad fruit in your life, one of the first steps needed to begin the journey of freedom from depression. How can you expect the outcome to change doing the same thing over and over again, without you yourself changing anything. It's common to not take any sort of action, yet continue to hop that some day the situation will change. It is common to become passive, and then the situation can eventually become hopeless. You are at whatever particular place in your life you are at due to your choices of attitude and actions that you've previously made. Some situations may appear to have been someone else's choice for you, but God to show you the truth, so that you can see your responsibility with your situation. You need to not play the 'victim' role. Once you begin to grasp this principle, you will be strengthened and can begin to make the necessary changes in your daily life. Spend time with God and seek Him daily, listen for His direction, and start to make the right choices in your life with all situations. You can choose to be a victim or victorious, powerless or powerful, each day. Life is about choices. We need to make the choice to forgive, choose not to judge, and choose not to make vows by giving it all to God. When you do this, you will be well on your journey toward freedom, peace, and contentment.
