	<br><br><strong>"All Rebounders Are NOT Created Equal"</strong>
	<br>
	<br>High-quality materials and superior American workmanship combine to bring you the top quality, Needak? rebounder. Some consumers have unknowingly purchased quality deficient, Asian imports that mimic the Needak? Soft-Bounce? rebounder. 

<br><br>
<strong>Specifications for the Perfect Rebounder:</strong>
<br><br>
"No one manufacturer has a lock on the market for rebounders, but some are better manufactured than others. It's best, perhaps, to purchase your exercise unit directly from the manufacturer.
<br><br>
Most important for excellent rebounding is the mat material. It should give no stretch during the downward landing, while at the same time providing a resilient rebound. Such a mat will be made from Permatron? material, which has a smooth finish. The Permatron? is resistant to ultraviolet rays, doesn't break down as do other fabrics, and allows no moisture absorption. Part of the specifications for a perfect rebounder is that its mat will be sewn together using 5760 stitches of high-grade nylon thread with two layers of strong polypropylene webbing stitched around the mat's edges.
<br><br>
Attached to a heavy-grade, all steel round frame should be an oversize spring mechanism holding four-inch-long, custom-made jumbo springs which deliver a soft bounce. Thirty-six springs made of quality wire will hold the mat to the frame. The springs should be shielded by a protective cover. Individual spring mounting pins prevent frame wear. Tapered coils help to give extended wearability to such springs. (Untapered coils allow low-quality springs to break frequently, requiring replacement.) Replacement springs must be available directly from the manufacturer since retail distributors seldom stock spare springs.
<br><br>
The balance bar is also available for those who would like it.
