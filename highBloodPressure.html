EDUCATION SESSION #1: 
<br><h1>~ HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ~</h1> 
Possible Bottom Line Causes: 
<br><br>
Impurities in the blood stream; toxic body; toxic bowel, toxic thoughts; toxic food, stress; too much cooked food and not enough fresh and raw fruits and veggies; not casting all your cares on God, salt and sea salt; caffiene drinks; alcohol.
<br><br>
<strong>Solutions:</strong> 
<br>
Change all of the above that apply to you; follow the Healthy Habits Check List on this web site; do colon cleanses; colonics, and/or warm water enemas(no coffee enemas). Add Juice Plus Vineyard Blend (dehydrated juice from 8 different types of berries and also from concord grapes, as well as extra good bacteria, live whole food enzymes, and green tea extract) to your lifestyle, as well as the Juice Plus Orchard and Garden blends: see <a href="http://www.juiceplus.com/+jm75450">www.juiceplus.com/+jm75450</a> for info, including overviews of medical research from research hospitals and universities around the world that shows how Juice Plus (dehydrated juice from 17 different fresh raw fruits and veggies and grains) raises antioxidants, increases immune function, reduces DNA damage, reduces lipid peroxides and other free radicals, and much much more.) 
<br><br>
Add fresh fruits and veggies to your life, learn to relax, learn to give all your cares to God, and put your faith and trust in Him and spend time with Him daily. Stop toxic intake of junk food and reduce cooked food. Work toward 80-85% of your food fresh and raw. Do "juice diets" on occasion. This means juicing fresh raw veggies all day so that you consume 1/2 to 1 gallon of juices a day and eat NO food.

"The news isn't that fruits and vegetables are good for you. 
<br>It's that they are so good for you they could save your life."
