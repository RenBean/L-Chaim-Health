<div id="center"><h1>~ The Benefits of Juicing  ~</h1>
by Dr. Joel Robbins </div>
<br><strong>JUICES</strong>
<br>Commercially produced juices are pasteurized (dead) and contain some or all of the following: Sugar (dextrose, fructose, corn syrup), food colorings, preservatives, synthetic vitamins, salt, other additives.
<br><br>
Health food store brands generally are pasteurized, but are otherwise fine. 
<br><br>
The best juice is freshly made and diluted 25-50% with distilled water. Freshly made, full strength juice is concentrated and should not be considered a drink, but a meal.
<br><br>
<strong>JUICING</strong>
<br>Everyone can benefit from juice regardless of the physical condition. Ideally, we would receive all our nutrition from our raw fruit and vegetable diet and thus, juicing would not be necessary. 
<br><br>
But because: 
<br>We do not eat almost totally raw foods. 
<br>The quality of the fresh produce is low. 
<br>The stress we live under affects assimilation of raw produce. 
<br><br>
Juicing, therefore, is a great means of filling the gaps as listed above. It can be likened to getting healing nutrients "wholesale", in that in the juiced form they are so easy to assimilate. All should consider purchasing a juicer, and engage in the drinking of raw fruit and vegetable-juice for the following reasons: 
<br><br>
Juiced foods require little or no digestion; thus, the healing nutrients of the raw fruits and vegetables are readily available for assimilation. Therefore, the overall healing process is made much more efficient, in that most people's digestive systems are so toxic and inefficient that their ability to break down raw fruits and vegetables is greatly hampered. (Cooked and processed foods are partially broken down before they are consumed.) The paradox is that raw foods provide the nutrients which heal the body, including the digestive system itself. Yet a sick digestive system is unable (to various degrees) to digest the food that will heal it. Digestive enzyme supplements are suggested in this case, and juicing will further remedy this situation. 
<br><br>
Juicing will serve to motivate one to continue on with the proper diet, as he sees the results through juicing. 
<br><br>
A glass of raw juice is the best "multivitamin/mineral supplement" money can buy. If you are concerned that you are not getting all the nutrients out of raw fruits and vegetables that you need, or you are just beginning to change your diet and want to increase your healing rate, drink at least a glass of raw juice daily. A 4-8 ounce glass of raw fruit or vegetable juice is like gold to your body. It provides not only all of the healing nutrients that have been isolated, but also all of those that man has yet to discover. It provides them in their living, organic, alkaline, whole, complete, balanced form. It is important to remember that juicing has a concentrating effect on the nutrients in fruits and vegetables. A glass of juice can (and should) be considered to be a meal in itself. (When juicing, take note of the quantity of fruits or vegetables used to make a glass of juice. Could you eat that much in one sitting?) Therefore, when juicing, keep the following guidelines in mind: 
<br><br>
Sip - drink slowly - a glass of juice. This allows for better assimilation. 
<br><br>
Drink the juice alone, not with solid food. Because juice is a concentrated food, a meal in itself, taking it with food would way overload the digestive system and defeat the purpose for drinking it. Allow at least one hour after drinking a glass of juice before eating any food, and until you are hungry. Likewise, do not drink juice until your stomach is empty after eating a meal or snack. 
<br><br>
Do not combine fruits and vegetables. As these require different digestive processes, fruits need to be separated from vegetables. 
<br>
<br>- All fruits may be mixed together. 
<br>- All vegetables may be mixed together. 
<br>- All melons may be mixed together. 
<br><br>
Exceptions: Lettuce and celery can be combined with either fruit or vegetable juice. Apples will mix with vegetable juices (this helps to sweeten). 
<br><br>
When making vegetable juice, make it predominately (80+%) either: 
<br>
<br>- carrot juice, or 
<br>- tomato juice 
<br><br>
mixing with these other vegetables as desired - celery, cucumbers, green peppers, etc. While vegetables generally do not contain as high amounts of glucose as fruits, carrot juice and tomato juice are both relatively sweet, and will carry the taste of other nutritious vegetables if mixed in.
