INTRODUCTION:
<br>If we take an honest look at nature, we will observe that three things are present:
<ol><li>Nature follows definite laws which are not subject to opinion or variance; and </li>
<li>Every aspect of life is reflected by nature.</li>
<li>Nature is governed by the law of CAUSE and EFFECT.</li>
</ol>
If we have violated a natural law, we have created a Cause, for which we will suffer an Effect.
<br>Our ignorance of the laws of Nature does not change these laws.
<br><br>
There are two reasons for disease, or lack of health
<ol>
<li>Ignorance </li>
<li>Laziness</li>
</ol>
In the field of health, there are a few good rules to follow to achieve health.
<br>
<ol>
<li>Follow the laws of Nature </li>
<li>Let Truth be your authority, not authority your truth.</li>
</ol>
One of the Laws of Nature is that the innate intelligence of the body strives to keep the body alive, regardless of the cost. The "cost" is what we call "disease". Disease is the effort of the body to keep us alive.
<br><br>
<strong>WHAT IS REAL FOOD?</strong>
<br>The body will keep us alive and healthy provided that we feed it "Real Food". Real food is a food which is compatible with the body; that in no way takes from the body, but lends itself to the building up of health and maintaining life. It contains nothing that is harmful, toxic or non-usable by the body.
<br><br>
Real Food is defined for us by Nature as follows:
<br>
<ol>
<li> Something edible grown by Nature - of the Plant Kingdom </li>
<li> Food which can be eaten without processing in any way. </li>
<li> Food which comes to us from Nature as "complete packages", that is, they contain naturally everything in them necessary for the body to process and assimilate that food.</li>
</ol><br>
<strong>WHY DO WE EAT FOOD?</strong>
<br>The only qualities of food which the body requires in a complete package are the following:
<br><br>
GLUCOSE, PROTEIN, FATTY ACIDS, MINERALS, ENZYMES, WATER.
<br><br>
If all of these components are in the food, the food is complete. If any of these are missing, the food is not "Real Food".
<br><br>
Real Food is provided by Nature in this form as raw fruits and vegetables. Raw fruits and vegetables contain all of the parts mentioned above. If food has been processed, cooked or altered in any way so as to change or eliminate any of the above ingredients, it is no longer "Real Food" as far as the Human Body is concerned. 
<br><br>
<strong>PLANTS ARE THE SOURCE OF REAL FOOD FOR ALL LIFE FORMS</strong>
<br>The plant kingdom utilizes sunshine, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water and organic minerals in the process of photosynthesis to feed itself and grow. The result is a living plant (food for animal consumption) containing: 
<br><ul>
<li>glucose</li>
<li>protein</li>
<li>fatty acids</li>
<li>organic minerals</li>
<li>organic enzymes (vitamins)</li>
<li>water (pure)</li>
</ul>
<strong>  Inorganic Mineral from the Earth + Photosynthesis = Organic Minerals </strong>from Plants which provide Protein and Enzymes for animals and humans.
<br><br>
The animal kingdom does not possess the ability to perform photosynthesis, therefore must rely on the plant kingdom to prepare its food.
<br><br>
Any form of processing nature's foods (such as pasteurization, cooking, adding preservatives, etc.) breaks the bonds between the food components and their attached enzymes as well as destroys the enzyme. The result is inorganic or denatured food components and thus inorganic food.
<br><br>
The enzyme must be alive and attached to the mineral or food component in order for the body to utilize it. The enzyme acts as a "passport" to get the mineral into the cell of the body and aids in the cell's utilization of that mineral. Raw foods are living and thus produce life in the body; because they have intact enzymes they are organic. Enzymes are catalysts -  substances which help the body work more efficiently in utilizing food for life maintaining purposes.
<br><br>
An example of an inorganic substance is table salt. It is simply sodium and chloride. No enzymes, thus it is dead and the body cannot use it. Our bodies cannot attach an enzyme to inorganic substances, except at great cost. It is only the plant kingdom, through the process of  photosynthesis, that can attach enzymes to inorganics and make them living or organic.
<br><br>
The more we process a food, the less nutrient value it retains. This is because living foods are organic foods. Processed foods, to various degrees, are inorganic or "dead" foods.
<br><br>
The following is the hierarchy of food preparation starting at the top with no preparation leaving the food with its full nutrient content, ending at the bottom with the most processing, rendering the food dead and useless to the body - little or no nutrient value retained:
<br><br>
RAW and WHOLE 
<br>JUICED and consumed immediately
<br>once the skin of fruits or vegetables is broken, oxygen combines with the enzymes and kills them (this process is called "oxidation") 
<br><br>
<strong>DEHYDRATED or DRIED</strong>
<br>loses 2-5% of nutrient value 
<br>dried without chemicals or additives 
<br>-commercial brands of dried fruit contain sulfur-dioxide; exception: raisins) 
<br><br>
<strong>FROZEN</strong>
<br>
freshly picked and frozen immediately 
<br>-loses 5-30% of nutrient value 
<br><br>
<strong>STEAMED</strong>
<br>loses 15 - 60% of nutrient value 
<br>-steamed means the green bean is still a bit crispy (if it's limp, its cooked) 
<br><br>
<strong>COOKED</strong>
<br>baked, broiled, boiled, grilled, steamed too long, home canned 
<br>-the green bean is limp 
<br>-loses 40 -100% of nutrient value, depending on how long it is cooked 
<br><br>
<strong>COOKED LEFTOVERS MICROWAVED</strong>
<br>
-Loses 90 - 99% of nutrient value 
<br>-COMMERCIALLY CANNED FOODS 
<br>-FRIED FOODS 
<br>-FOODS with ADDITIVES
<br>these not only lose 100% of their nutrient value, but have toxins added to them 
<br><br>
<strong>ACID/ALKALINE BALANCE</strong>
<br>The Textbook of Medical Physiology by Arthur C. Guyton, M.D., probably the most recognized authority on human physiology states: "...the regulation of hydrogen ion concentration (pH or acid/alkaline balance) is one of the most important aspects of homeostasis." (Homeostasis is where the components involved seek an equilibrium.)
<br><br>
DEFINITIONS: 
<br>
ph = measure of how acid or how alkaline a substance is. 
<br>ph scale = scale of measurement for acidity and alkalinity. 
<br><br>

<br>
All chemical processes have an ideal pH at which they are most efficient. For example the body functions best with an internal chemistry being slightly alkaline (pH of 7.0 to 8.0). The pH of the blood is even more specific:
<br><br>
<strong>BLOOD ph 7.4 = Normal<-----/----->7.2 = DEATH</strong>
<br>
Our internal body chemistry functions in an alkaline environment. Our blood must maintain a pH of 7.4. If it drops below that to 7.2 we die.
<br><br>
<strong>The cells of the body in health are alkaline.</strong> In disease the cell pH is below 7.0. The more acid the cells become, the sicker we are and feel. The cells won't die until their pH gets to about 3.5. Our bodies produce acid as a by-product of normal metabolism. This is the result of our bodies burning or using alkaline to remain alive. Since our bodies do not manufacture alkaline, we must supply the alkaline from an outside source to keep us from becoming acid and dying.
<br><br><strong> Food is the means of replenishing the alkaline to the body. </strong>The main determining factor of alkaline is the organic minerals. One can equate organic minerals with alkaline for better understanding. Foods are of two types, acid or alkaline. This refers to the ash value of a food. (Meaning the type of residue that remains after the food is digested and processed). Is it acid, or is it alkaline? If there is an acid residue (inorganic acids), the body must neutralize this acid to keep the blood from getting acid. The acid is neutralized with alkaline.
<br><br>Ideally there is adequate alkaline in the diet to do this. However, if there is not, the body must extract alkaline from its cells to neutralize the acid. This, of course, causes the cells to become acid, and thus diseased. Because our bodies are an alkaline entity, in order to maintain health, the majority of our diet must consist of alkaline ash foods.
<br><br><strong>We can remain in health by consuming a diet that is 70-80% alkaline and 20-30% acid</strong>. The more alkaline the better. If we become too alkaline by eating a majority of alkaline foods, we will lose our appetite and automatically want to fast, during which time the normal acid metabolic by-products will return the body' s pH back to normal. It is interesting to note that some foods which qualify as a real food have an acid ash reaction. This is probably nature's way of keeping a balance so that the real food consumer does not become too alkaline. Also note that the acid content of these acid ash real foods is very low and they still contain valuable nutrients which can be utilized by the body.
<br><br>
The following is a list of the acid and alkaline foods:
<br><br>
<strong>ACID/ALKALINE BALANCE</strong>
<br>
The breakdown of foods into acid ash and alkaline ash categories would generally be as follows:
<br><br>
NOTE: Foods in the Acid Ash column are listed in order of least acid to most acid; in the alkaline ash column, foods are listed in order from most alkaline to least alkaline. 
<br><br>
<strong><u>ACID ASH</u></strong>
<br>
SOME RAW FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (cranberries, blueberries, plums, prunes, squash)
<br>WHOLE GRAINS - COOKED
<br>OVERCOOKED FRUITS / VEGGIES
<br>DAIRY PRODUCTS (cheese, eggs, milk, etc)
<br>SUGAR and REFINED GRAINS

<br>Raw, Rare, Well Done 
<br>RED MEATS (beef, pork, mutton) Raw, Rare, Well Done
<br>HERBS, SPICES, CONDIMENTS, SPICY FOODS (garlic, hot peppers, onions, horseradish, etc.) 
<br>FRIED FOOD, COFFEE, TEA, SALT, ALCHOHOL 
<br>DRUGS & MEDICATIONS, TOBACCO
<br><br>
<u><strong>ALKALINE ASH</strong></u>
<br>RAW FRUITS

<br>LIGHTLY STEAMED FRUITS & VEGGIES
<br>RAW NUTS (almonds, pecans, cashews, etc.)
<br>SPROUTED GRAINS  
<br><br>
The average American diet consists of: 20-30% alkaline foods, & the diet should consist of at least: 70-80% ALKALINE FOODS & 20-30% ACID FOODS. It is not unusual for the average American to go 7 to 14 days without eating ANY alkaline foods. 
<br><br>
<strong>DISEASE AND ITS CAUSE</strong>
<br>
Disease or "dis-ease" is defined as a lack of health. Disease results when any cell is not functioning 100% of its designed duty whether due to trauma, toxicity, lack of communication or a combination thereof. Disease is due to stress.
<br><br>
Whether due to ignorance or laziness, exposing the body to stress will produce a diseased state of the body. Stress is the only means of tearing down health resulting in disease, our bodies paying the price for violating the laws of nature (our wrong doings). We do not "catch" a disease or illness, we earn it. We must "work" for disease.
<br><br>
Disease is nothing more than the body responding to the wrong we have done to it. It is the body's attempt at keeping us alive in response to the wrongs we have inflicted on our bodies.
<br><br>
Pathological changes are the cell's response to stress. These changes or compensations allow the body to survive - maintain homeostasis - as long as the stress continues. These tissue changes, which result in disease, are the outward manifestation of internal compensation to stress. Until the cause is removed, the condition will remain in one form or another. 
<br><br>
<strong>SYMPTOMS</strong>
<br>
Medically speaking a symptom is defined as a sign or indication of a disease or illness.
<br><br>
It is thought that if the symptom is treated and eradicated, then the disease or illness has been cured.
<br><br>
Symptoms are viewed somewhat differently from a natural healing perspective in that:
<br><br>
Symptoms are indicators that there is an abnormal condition within the body which is producing a state of "dis-ease". 
<br><br>
A symptom or a group of symptoms are given a specific name depending on the type and location of the symptom(s). Medically this name is known as a "disease" or "illness". From a natural healing standpoint, a named disease or illness is interchangeable with the word "symptom". 
<br><br>
A symptom (disease/illness) is the body's effort to eliminate toxins from the body; to return the body to a state of health when stimulated; to undo any damage that has been done to the body. 
<br><br>
A symptom is the body's effort to stay alive while coping with anything detrimental that has been done or is being done to the body. 
<br><br>
Diseases/illnesses/symptoms are the body's attempt to restore health and maintain life. 
<br><br>
<strong>THE DISEASE PROCESS</strong>
<br>
<strong>The two primary ways that toxins enter the blood stream and thus the body are:</strong>
<ol>
<li>THAT WHICH IS TAKEN IN BY THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM (eaten or drunk)</li> 
<li>THAT WHICH IS TAKEN IN BY THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM (breathed)</li>
</ol>
Initially, due to cell irritability, the body will reject toxins being introduced via these two avenues. This is done via:
<br><br>
non-palatable foods - burning sensation of mouth, throat, tongue, esophagus, stomach coughing, sneezing - irritation or burning sensation of mucus membranes of air passage
<br><br>
<strong>These defenses can be over-ridden by: </strong>
<br>
- continued toxic input 
<br>- disguising toxins (with use of sugar)
<br>- conditioned response or learned (educated) override 
<br><br>
<strong>The digestive system is now responsible for keeping toxins out of the body.</strong> This is initially done by vomiting or diarrhea. As the toxic abuse continues, the digestive system becomes less efficient at ridding toxic input via the above mentioned methods. The result is that toxins now begin to be absorbed into the body.
<br><br>
The liver now takes on the responsibility of keeping the body clear of toxins. This is done by the liver neutralizing the toxic acids with its alkaline minerals before they enter the blood stream on their way to the other organs of elimination-kidneys, lungs, bowel. The acids must be neutralized prior to entering the blood stream, otherwise the blood would become too acid and death would rapidly ensue.
<br><br>
It quickly becomes apparent to the liver that if it continues burning its alkaline supplies it would be too acid to continue to survive and the liver would be sacrificed, which would result in death of the body. In order to slow down the liver's loss of alkaline, the liver will begin to store toxins within itself. Thus the liver becomes congested. The more congested it becomes the less efficient it is at carrying out its normal metabolic functions for maintaining health of the body, and the overall health level begins its downward turn. Even so, the liver, and thus the body, will be able to survive many years longer than if the liver had depleted its alkaline supplies.
<br><br>
Once the liver reaches a level of approximately 70% congestion, it can no longer afford to retain poisons at the same rate, otherwise death of the liver would shortly result once it reached a level of 100% congestion.
<br><br>
To offset this, the liver begins to allow some toxins to enter the blood stream. These are not neutralized, the cellular buffer system goes to work in less than a second to neutralize them keeping the blood from becoming acid. This is done at the expense of the cells alkaline supplies. The cells of the body realize very quickly what the liver realized some time back: They would not survive long should they continue to give up their alkaline minerals at such a rate. As a result, the cells employ the same method of survival the liver did, ie. to allow acid toxins to leave the blood stream and enter the tissues. This does two things:
<br><br>
<strong>NOTE: </strong>The cells still continue to give up alkaline for neutralization of toxins in the blood, and for buffering of normal metabolic waste products, thus their over-all health level is continually declining, but at a much slower rate than if this "exchange program" were not enacted.
<br><br>
<strong>1) Keeps the cells from having to expend great quantities of alkaline, thus prolonging their life. 
<br>2) Keeps the blood pH within normal limits, thus life (though not in health) continues</strong>
<br><br>
The storage of toxins in the tissues of the body -temporary or not- is known as a toxic state. More specifically, a toxic state is defined as: an accumulation of toxins, poisons, mucus and/or pus in any tissue of the body a localized area of constipation.  In a healthy condition, no toxins are to be found in any tissue at any time. 
<br><br>
As the tissues take in toxins from the blood, they will initially attempt to eliminate the toxins from the body. This elimination of toxins is not through the normal channels of elimination, because this would require the toxins to pass through the blood stream. Rather an alternate avenue is used which is not designed for elimination. This is called <strong>vicarious elimination</strong>.
<br><br>
The more vitality (the higher the health level) the tissues have, the more irritability they possess, thus the more vigorous will be the eliminative reaction of the tissues, or the more intense will be the symptoms of elimination. These symptoms of elimination are known as either an acute illness or a sub acute illness.
<br><br>
The toxins eliminated from the body via acute and sub acute illnesses are generally through a tissue that is on the surface of the body; e.g..: skin, mucus membranes. (See chart on page 21.)
<br><br>
Acute and sub acute illnesses are carried out with the aid of the endocrine system - mainly thyroid and adrenal glands.
<br><br>
As the toxic input continues, combined with suppression of acute cleansing reactions (via drugs, herbs, etc.) the cells continue to become more toxic, more acid, and have a lowered vitality. Desensitized, the tissues can no longer afford the energy or nutrient resources required for an acute cleansing response, and must resort to a less efficient mode of vicarious elimination. This is known as chronic disease. While chronic diseases generally utilize the various surfaces of the body, the main differentiating factor between acute/sub acute illnesses and chronic diseases, is that chronic diseases are not carried out at the expense of the endocrine system, or at least, not to the degree of the acute/sub acute illness.
<br><br>
With continued wrong living and eating habits, the continued suppression of eliminative processes, the continued depletion of alkaline supplies, the continued toxicity of the tissues, the vitality of the cells decreases to the level that the cells can no longer afford the energy required to produce even minimal vicarious elimination (as in chronic diseases). All the body can afford to do is simply store the toxins in the tissues where they remain. This at least keeps the blood stream from becoming acid, negating immediate death. As a result of this long term storage of toxins, the tissues involved begin to degenerate, meaning the tissues are altered from their normal or designed structure. This is known as a chronic degenerative disease. The functioning of the cells, and thus tissues, is therefore altered greatly. The tissues, in essence, are mutated from their normal state.
<br><br>
Death of the body results when one or a combination of the following is true:
<br><br>
The vitality of the body is so low that it can no longer mobilize toxins out of the blood stream into the tissues, resulting in acid/toxic blood. 
<br><br>
The cells of the body no longer possess adequate alkaline to neutralize acids in the blood stream, resulting in acid blood. 
<br><br>
The cells of the body (may be a localized area, e.g..: heart) become so acid and toxic that they can no longer function efficiently enough to carry on their part of the life process, resulting in death of the entire body. 
<br><br>
If illness is stopped through detoxification, and wrong living habits continue, the toxins which the body was attempting to eliminate via the illness or disease will be driven deeper into the body setting the stage for a more toxic, more serious, more chronic disease.  
<br><br>
<strong>THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY</strong>
<br>
Diseases and illness are not "caught" or acquired by fate. They are  earned, some out of ignorance and some laziness, but nonetheless, earned. There are several questions which arise when the above concept of "working" for diseases is discussed. Such questions as:
<br><br>
If we don't catch diseases, how come when the flu is going around everyone seems to get it? 
<br>How come not every one catches a cold when colds are going around? 
<br>How come two people eating basically the same diet, living the same lifestyle will develop different diseases? 
<br>If disease is caused by violating the laws of nature, how come a man in his 90's who has violated these laws all of his life is in relatively good health, and his two year old grandson is dying of cancer - a chronic degenerative disease? 
<br>There are four main factors which determine the diseases or illnesses one will develop when they violate nature's laws. These are:
<br><ol>
<li>ATTITUDE</li>
<li>TYPES AND SEVERITY OF STRESS</li>
<li>VITALITY OF THE BODY</li>
<li>GENETIC POTENTIAL</li>
</ol>
<strong>1) ATTITUDE AND ITS RELATION TO DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY</strong>
<br>
There is no question now that attitudes and emotions play a major role in the health of the body. Science has always suspected this; the mechanism is now beginning to be understood - there is a definite cause-and-effect relationship between food, attitudes and health, as well as wrong attitudes and disease.
<br><br>
<strong>2) TYPES AND SEVERITY OF STRESS</strong>
<br>
Different stresses will affect the body in different ways, thus different ailments will be manifest in different parts of the body. This factor is only minimally influenced by genetic tendency, but may establish new genetic weaknesses for offspring.
<br><br>
Eg.: A cigarette smoker will obviously store much of the noxious toxins of this habit in his lung tissue, whether he has genetically weak lung tissue or not. However if he does happen to have genetic weaknesses of the lungs, the symptoms resultant from smoking will manifest much earlier than one who does not have genetically inferior lung tissue.
<br><br>
The body, in some cases at least, attempts to eliminate or storespecific toxins through certain avenues. Some examples:
<br><br>
- salt via the skin (perspiration tastes salty) 
<br>- uric acid stored in the big toe, feet (gout) 
<br><br>
Also, the more severe or toxic the stress engaged, the greater the toll it will take on the health of the body.
<br><br>
<strong>3) VITALITY OF THE BODY</strong>
<br>
By definition, the vitality of the body refers to the overall energy level of the body, how much irritability the cells possess, the closeness of cell pH to 7.0, how free the tissues are of toxins, etc. The greater the vitality, the more energy the cells will have, therefore the greater will be the vicarious elimination efforts by the tissues. This vicarious elimination will be directed towards the surface of the body - to get it out of the body. Thus the mucus membranes and skin will generally be the avenues of exit where symptoms will arise when the body's vitality is high. Eg.: sinusitis, ear infections, measles, chicken pox, etc.
<br><br>
As the vitality lowers, due to continued toxic input, stress and suppressing cleansing reactions, the body, not being able to afford the energy to perform vicarious elimination, must simply store the toxins in its tissues, in deeper layers of the body. Eg.: Arthritis, cancer, senility, diabetes, etc.
<br><br>
<strong>4) GENETIC POTENTIAL</strong>
<br>
<strong>Diseases are not inherited; rather the tendency or potential of a disease is passed on from parents to offspring.</strong>
<br><br>
The disease tendency is transferred via the genetic code. A genetic tendency is just that: a potential disease. A genetic weakness does not have to manifest as a disease unless the laws of nature are violated.
<br><br>
Only then will the weakness manifest.
<br><br>
E.g.: The father has a heart problem. He will pass on to his child(ren) genetically weak heart tissue. This does not necessarily mean the child is born with a heart problem. Nor does it mean the child ever has to have a heart problem; however, should the child violate the laws of nature, the violations will take their toll in the weakest tissue(s) of the body - in this case the heart.
<br><br>
Genetic weaknesses or tendencies grow weaker with each succeeding generation if the parents are engaged in a stressful lifestyle, including toxic diet. Thus the amount of wrong doing that is required for a genetic weakness to become clinical (manifest) grows less and less as the genetic tendencies become weaker. As a result, a child on a toxic diet may manifest a heart condition passes on to him genetically at a very early age as compared to the age of his father developing a heart condition. It is even possible that the child could develop the clinical manifestation of the weakness before the father does.
<br><br>
Likewise, a grandparent may live all of his life, violating the laws of nature and never manifest a problem in the particular area that his offspring do. This is because either:
<br><br>
The grand parent's weakness was so minor that he died of other causes before this weakness became clinical; or, 
<br><br>
The grandparent did not actually have a genetic weakness, but due to his stressful lifestyle, passed on a genetic weakness to his offspring 
<br><br>
<strong>The Pottinger Cat Experiments </strong>illustrate the genetic tendency principles.
<br><br>
In the 1940's, a medical doctor, Francis M. Pottinger, made an experiment using 900 cats to determine what effects processed foods have on the body. The cats were divided into five groups. Two of the groups were fed whole foods-raw milk and meat - real foods for cats. The other three groups were given denatured foods pasteurized, evaporated and condensed milk. All the groups were fed the same minimal basic diet to sustain life. However, the predominant portion of the diets were either real foods or denatured foods as listed above. <br><br>The cats were observed over a four generation period and the following results were documented by Dr. Pottinger:

<strong>DRUG THERAPY</strong>
<br>
If you have a headache, the doctor prescribes aspirin. The headache disappears and everyone is happy. No one ever asked the question, "What caused the headache?". Based on the treatment prescribed and the resultant "cure", we can conclude that the headache was caused by an "aspirin deficiency". However, a little research will tell us that aspirin is composed of salicylic acid - an absolute poison to the body, thus an "aspirin deficiency" is out of the question. In fact, any drug on the market, we will find, is composed of chemical toxins which are poisonous to humans. How then can drugs alleviate symptoms, cure ills, wipe out disease and generally make us feel better if they are poisonous?
<br><br>
To understand how drugs "cure" symptoms, let us look a little deeper into how aspirin takes away a pain. Did you know that aspirin will relieve any pain in the body, whether it be a headache or a toe ache? The only exception to this is stomach pain. Aspirin will not help stomach pain. Ask the pharmacist how aspirin works, he will tell you that it has some sort of numbing effect over the entire body, so regardless of where the pain is, it is relieved. But isn't the stomach part of the body? Why doesn't aspirin take care of stomach pain? He will reply that this is one of the great mysteries of aspirin.
<br><br>
Let's say you are out on the farm hunting and you get a thorn in your finger. It is quite sore, so you decide to head back to your truck to get some tweezers to take care of the problem. As you pass through the barn yard you step on a nail. Do you still feel the pain of the thorn in your finger, in fact do you even remember it is there? Was it suddenly cured when you stepped on the nail? No, not at all. Then why is the thorn no longer a concern? Simply because your body now has a higher priority - something more life threatening to worry about - the nail in the foot.
<br><br>
Then as you are passing through the barbed wire fence to finally reach your truck, you shoot your toe off with the shotgun (the other foot of course). Are you now aware of the thorn? No. How about the hole in your foot from the rusty nail. I don't think so. Why not? Once again the body shifted its focus to the most life threatening situation. There is only x amount of energy in the body. If we create a crisis in one part of the body, energy must be "borrowed" from other parts of the body to cope with the crisis.
<br><br>
Every aspirin (buffered or not) causes a teaspoon worth of bleeding in the stomach. If you have a headache, which is generally caused by toxic blood from something we've eaten which is harmful to us, and you take an aspirin causing internal bleeding, which do you think would be more life threatening? In most cases the internal bleeding. The body must now shift its attention to the higher priority problem (stomach), and the headache disappears. Did the aspirin remove the toxins from the blood stream? Not at all, just created a more life threatening situation.
<br><br>
If the aspirin does not take away the headache, it simply means that the internal bleeding is not more life threatening than the toxic blood. So now take six aspirin, and a more life theatening situation will take place in the stomach and the headache dissipates.
<br><br>
Why doesn't aspirin take care of stomach pain? If you have stomach pain then your body's attention is already focused on the stomach. Additional stress there will not force the body to shift its attention elsewhere in the body. Tylenol, however, will alleviate stomach pain because it plays havoc with the liver, causing the body to move its attention from stomach to liver. Thus all drugs produce symptomatic relief without actually removing the cause.
<br><br>
A drug "cures" your complaint by creating a disease of its own. If the poison of the drug, whatever drug you want to name, is more life threatening to the body than the symptom for which you took the drug (or the doctor's prescription for such), then your symptoms will disappear. If the drug is not more life threatening, then it will not produce symptomatic relief and the doctor will prescribe a stronger, more poisonous, more life threatening drug. Now the body will be forced to focus on the drug so that the drug literally doesn't kill the body. You become symptom free. Yet the cause of the disease was not eliminated, and true healing did not take place. Since there is no such thing as a drug deficiency, the body simply put the disease process on hold to eliminate the drug. How many children do you know that take antibiotics for infections? The antibiotic stops the symptoms. As soon as the antibiotic is stopped, the infection returns. It is because the antibiotic does not kill the infection, rather the antibiotic is so toxic to the liver and rest of the body, that the body must wall off, or put on "hold" the infective process to deal with the drug before it kills the body. Once the drug is dealt with, the body will, as soon as it has built up adequate nutrients and energies, resume the cleansing process via the infection. If the taking of the antibiotic was so devitalizing to the body, lowering its frequency, the infection may not return, only a more serious chronic disease at a later date.
<br><br>
One of the great laws of nature is the law of cause and effect. We do not gain anything without working for it. Diseases are not "caught",  they are earned by not taking care of our bodies. How then can we not stop doing the wrong that made us sick, take a drug and get well? It is the same as the drunk saying, "Sober me up with a pill, but let me keep drinking". Impossible to do. Disease is no exception.
<br><br>
When anesthetic is administered to knock one out for surgery, the same principle applies. The anesthetic is so poisonous to the body, that the body must put itself to sleep to free up the tremendous amount of energy that is used for consciousness. This energy is then utilized to eliminate the toxic anesthetic from the body before it causes death.
<br><br>
Why do you think people are so sick and groggy after surgery. Why do something like 2% of people who undergo surgery die from the anesthetic if it weren't a poison? Different drugs rob energy from different parts of the body, thus they have various effects or "cure" different symptoms.
<br><br>
The bottom line is that they rob energy from the body, change the body's priorities to focus on the drug - a more life threatening situation - and the cause is not eliminated. We are actually still sick, just as some must stay on drugs a lifetime to stay symptom free, constantly increasing the dose as they become sicker and sicker. Others are "cured" by the drug and can stop taking it, only to face another more serious disease down the road. If we would just listen to the body when we become ill, let the illness tell us our symptoms are due to something wrong we are doing (wrong diet or life style), stop doing it, then the illness as well as the need for drugs would be eliminated and a more healthy life would result.
<br><br>
<strong>Side-Effects</strong>
<br>
"Side-effects" which often result when drugs are administered are the body's effort at eliminating the drug. Eg.: breaking out in a skin rash - body pushing drug out through skin, getting drowsy - body conserving conscious energy in order to stay alive while eliminating the drug.
<br><br>
<strong>The Logic of Drug Therapy</strong>
<br>Drug therapy defies all logic when we consider that any drug administered to a healthy person will make him sick, and yet the doctor prescribes these very poisons to a sick person and expects him to get well. How can a body be poisoned back to health? 
<br><br><br>
<strong>THE HEALING CAPABILITY OF THE BODY</strong>
<br>
Is there such a thing as an incurable disease? From a medical standpoint many diseases are incurable. The only reason some diseases are deemed incurable by the medical profession is because they have yet to get out of the body's way and let it work in restoring itself to health. They have yet to learn about removing the cause. The medical profession is bent on "curing" the body. This is done by providing symptomatic relief. In so doing, they not only hinder all or most healing activity of the body, but actually produce a more stressful condition for the body, lowering its immune system, leading to a more serious diseased condition.
<br><br>
This body is not designed nor programmed to be diseased. It does not know how to be diseased. The only thing the body knows is survival. Disease is the body's effort at surviving in the face of violations of natural laws that govern the body.
<br><br>
If the body has the intelligence to produce a disease, it is capable of reversing the process to return to health once the cause is removed. Disease is a compensation or reaction to a wrong committed. The body holds on to the disease in order to survive in the face of the violation of a natural law which continues to be committed. The removal of the violation - physical or emotional - then would allow the body to withdraw its survival mechanism and return to health. The longer the body has had to be in a survival mode the longer it will take to return to health.
<br><br>
Since the body is programmed and knows only health, it is absurd and narrow-minded to state that the body cannot return to health (that a disease is incurable). The only limitation to the body's return to health is the limitations we put on the body, both out of ignorance and indifference.
<br><br>
All diseases are curable by the body by adhering to natural healing-principles. Some people find themselves diseased, change to a natural living lifestyle and do not gain total health, some even die of the disease. This is for one or both of  two reasons: 
<br><br>
In attitude they were not ready for the responsibility of health, were not willing to learn the lesson for which the disease was a symptom. 
<br><br>
The disease process had such a momentum going that not enough time was available for the sick, toxic, inefficient body to utilize the newly introduced nutrients and energies for reversing the disease before the disease killed the body. Remember it is the body's action or utilization of the nutrients for healing, not the nutrients' action on the body.
<br><br>
<strong>HOW LONG TO HEALTH?</strong>
<br>
Just as the body does not get toxic and diseased overnight, it also cannot "clean house" and rebuild itself overnight. A person may spend years tearing their body down and filling it with toxins, so an immediate healing is impossible. It is doubtful if anyone can become totally healthy within one year no matter how dedicated one is to healthful living and eating. Those using a "transition diet" approach are looking at several years until health returns, providing their "transition diet" is continually upgraded. However, many improvements in the body's health take place along the way to give encouragement to continue pursuing a health-producing lifestyle.
<br><br><br>
<strong>FACTORS INFLUENCING THE LENGTH OF HEALING TIME</strong>
<br>HOW QUICKLY ONE ADOPTS HEALTHFUL LIVING HABITS
<br>Proper exercise 
<br>Adequate rest/sleep 
<br>Pleasant surrounding/environment 
<br>Sunshine 
<br>Nutritious dietary intake 
<br>Positive mental attitude 
<br><br>
<strong>HOW QUICKLY ONE DOES AWAY WITH WRONG LIVING HABITS</strong>
<br>Elimination of those things which made the body diseased 
<br>e.g.: stresses, stimulants, toxins, etc.
<br><br><br>
<strong>THE OVERALL LEVEL OF VITALITY OF THE BODY</strong>
<br>
THIS IS DEPENDENT ON: 
<br>Degree of Degeneration of the Body 
<br>Level of Acidity of the Body Cells 
<br>Amount of Accumulated Toxins in the Body
<br><br>
THE AMOUNT OF "WANT TO" ONE POSSESSEZ
<br>
self discipline, determination, desire to be healthy
<br>DEGREE OF FREEDOM FROM PENT-UP EMOTIONAL SCARS AND ENERGIES
<br><br>
LACK OF ONGOING EMOTIONAL/MENTAL ANXIETY
<br><br>
AMOUNT OF WORRY AND ANXIETY OVER THE HEALING PROCESS
<br><br>
Lack of understanding of true healing
<br><br>
<strong>SPIRITUAL ALIGNMENT</strong>
<br>ATTEMPTS TO "HELP OUT" NATURE WITH THE HEALING PROCESS
<br>'Treating' symptoms arising due to true healing process using 'natural' and unnatural remedies to 'promote health' Generally it takes one year of healing for every seven years of living a toxic lifestyle.<br>
