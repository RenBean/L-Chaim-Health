<p>Did you know that essential oils from plants make wonderful gifts? Essential oils have amazing natural healing power if you buy the pure undiluted non polluted ones. They increase the oxygen levels, and the wonderful negative ion levels; many are antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial, antitumoral, antiviral, antiparasitic. Many relieve tension and stress, many relax, some regenerate nerves, some detoxify, some help bring joy and peace, some relax muscles. And the list goes on and on! They are God's medicine cabinet and God's first aid kits in a bottle.</i>

<td><strong>LAVENDER - 15 ML</strong>
<br>
(Lavandula angustifolia) has a fresh, sweet, floral, herbaceous aroma that is soothing and refreshing. Because it is the most versatile of all essential oils, no home should be without it. It is great for winding down before bedtime, yet has balancing properties that make it just as beneficial for boosting stamina and energy.* Therapeutic-grade lavender is highly regarded for skin and beauty. It may be used to cleanse cuts, bruises, and skin irritations. The French scientist Rene? Gattefosse? was the first to discover these properties when he severely burned his hands in a laboratory explosion. Using lavender oil, he noticed a remarkable healing soon afterwards. Lavender has an approximate ORAC of 3,669 (TE/L). TE/L is expressed as micromole Trolox equivalent per liter.

	<td><strong>PEPPERMINT - 15 ML</strong>
<br>
(Mentha piperita) has a strong, clean, fresh, minty aroma. One of the oldest and most highly-regarded herbs for soothing digestion, it may also improve gastric motility and digestive efficiency.* Jean Valnet, M.D., studied peppermint's effect on the liver and respiratory systems. Other scientists have also researched peppermint's role in improving taste and smell when inhaled. Dr. William N. Dember of the University of Cincinnati studied peppermint's ability to improve concentration and mental activity. Alan Hirsch, M.D., studied peppermint's ability to directly affect the brain's satiety center, which triggers a sensation of fullness after meals. Peppermint has an approximate ORAC of 373,455 (TE/L)
